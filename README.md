## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for implementing Local Storage functionality and Event Delegation.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the project and experience the Local Storage and Event Delegation functionality.

## Dependencies
This project does not have any external dependencies. It only requires a modern web browser to run the HTML file.

## Project Details
In this project, we use JavaScript to interact with the Local Storage API. Items added by the user are stored in Local Storage and dynamically displayed in the UI using Event Delegation. Event Delegation helps in efficiently managing and handling events for dynamically added elements.

## Key Concepts
- **Local Storage**: Utilizing the browser's Local Storage to store and retrieve data persistently.
- **Event Delegation**: Applying event delegation to manage events efficiently for dynamically created elements.
